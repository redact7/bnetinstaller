# bnetinstaller
very basic battle.net installer, only tested with black ops 4

#### usage
- make sure battle.net is open
- `.\bnetinstaller.exe --prod viper --lang enUS --dir "C:\Games\Black Ops 4"`
- it will start downloading in the background your battle.net client should eventually update to show it downloading, if not close and reopen it
